# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
We analyzed past and current Kickstarter performance, focusing on plays in the US.
### Purpose
In order to determine the best possible methods to ensure the greatest possibilty of success for "Fever", an upcoming play Kickstarter campaign, we compared similar campaigns and analyzed what made them more or less successful. 
## Analysis and Challenges
With data on thousands of Kickstarters from over the lifetime of the platfrom, we compared the results of play projects against their release dates and against their original funding goals. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Outcomes Vs. Launch Date](/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
As you can see in the above chart, the month in which a project begins has a significant effect on the success of the project. While the overall number of submitted campaigns varies throughout the year, we can observe that successful projects spike in May, followed by a steady decline across the Summer months. Due to this observation, we can reccommend that Fever is launched as close to the beginning of Summer as possible. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![Outcomes Vs. Goals](/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
The above chart illustrates the percentage of successful and failed campaigns with different funding goals. We can observe that for projects with a funding goal under 15000 dollars, over half of the proposed projects were fully funded. With that in mind, Louise's proposed goal of 12,000 dollars puts her in a cohort of medium-risk campaigns, with just under a 60% precedent of success. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The scope of the data provided is massive, and much of it is, frankly, inapplicable to our circumstances. Filtering and reducing our data to relevant points in order to get the most cogent report possible was the greatest challenge. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The best time to launch a play on Kickstarter is in the late spring or early summer. The worst times to launch a play kickstarter are the winter months, with a decrease of nearly half in the number of successfully funded projects.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Overambitious projects, those with funding goals over 15,000 dollars, have a lower success rate than projects that are looking for less that 14,999 dollars of funding. Furthermore, there is a sharp decline in success between projects that are asking less that 5000 dollars and those asking more. There is an additional spike of successful projects between 35,000 and 45,000 dollars pledged, however the small number of projects that ask for that amount of money make it difficult to draw any clear conclusions, as only nine projects total had thier funding goals in that range. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
As discussed above, there are many datapoints that are broadly inapplicable to our primary questions. After filtering out irrelevant data, the number of data points we are left with, while still sufficient to be statistically relevant, is somewhat anemic. There are some categories within our data that are less than ten data points deep. This can lead to potentially misleading blips, like the high success rate of plays asking for 35,000 dollars or more. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Another element of Kickstarter's model is Spotlight, a system wher certain projects are advertised within the Kickstarter website and beyond. Comparing the success of Spotlit and non-spotlit campaigns could be a great way to ensure we are considering all possible variables when attempting to create a successful campaign.
